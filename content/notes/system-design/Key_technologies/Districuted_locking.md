# Districuted Locking

---

#### Schenario : Ticket master

When you're dealing with online systems like Ticketmaster, you might need a way to lock a resource - like a concert ticket - for a short time (~10 minutes in this case). This is so while one user is in the middle of buying a ticket, no one else can grab it. Traditional databases with ACID properties use transaction locks to keep data consistent, which is great for ensuring that while one user is updating a record, no one else can update it, but they're not designed for longer-term locking. This is where distributed locks come in handy.

Distributed locks are perfect for situations where you need to lock something across different systems or processes for a reasonable period of time. They're often implemented using a distributed key-value store like Redis

The basic idea is that you can use a key-value store to store a lock and then use the atomicity of the key-value store to ensure that only one process can acquire the lock at a time. For example, if you have a Redis instance with a key ticket-123 and you want to lock it, you can set the value of ticket-123 to locked. If another process tries to set the value of ticket-123 to locked, it will fail because the value is already set to locked. Once the first process is done with the lock, it can set the value of ticket-123 to unlocked and another process can acquire the lock.

Another handy feature of distributed locks is that they can be set to expire after a certain amount of time. This is great for ensuring that locks don't get stuck in a locked state if a process crashes or is killed. For example, if you set the value of ticket-123 to locked and then the process crashes, the lock will expire after a certain amount of time (like 10 minutes) and another process can acquire the lock at that point.

### Use cases:

1. E commerce check out system - Use a distributed lock to hold a high-demand item, like limited-edition sneakers, in a user's cart for a short duration (like 10 minutes) during checkout to ensure that while one user is completing the payment process, the item isn't sold to someone else.
2. **Ride-Sharing Matchmaking:** A distributed lock can be used to manage the assignment of drivers to riders. When a rider requests a ride, the system can lock a nearby driver, preventing them from being matched with multiple riders simultaneously.

## Mechanisms:

**Locking Mechanisms**: There are different ways to implement distributed locks. One common implementation uses Redis and is called Redlock. Redlock uses multiple Redis instances to ensure that a lock is acquired and released in a safe and consistent manner.

**Lock Expiry**: Distributed locks can be set to expire after a certain amount of time. This is important for ensuring that locks don't get stuck in a locked state if a process crashes or is killed.

**Deadlocks**: Deadlocks can occur when two or more processes are waiting for each other to release a lock. Think about a situation where two processes are trying to acquire two locks at the same time. One process acquires lock A and then tries to acquire lock B, while the other process acquires lock B and then tries to acquire lock A. This can lead to a situation where both processes are waiting for each other to release a lock, causing a deadlock. You should be prepared to discuss how to prevent this - a common mistake is to have locks pulled from far-flung pieces of infrastructure or your code, this makes it hard to recognize and prevent deadlocks.

**Locking Granularity**: Distributed locks can be used to lock a single resource or a group of resources. For example, you might want to lock a single ticket in a ticketing system or you might want to lock a group of tickets in a section of a stadium.

A relational database consists of a collection of tables, each of which is assigned a unique name. In general, a row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. Since a table is a collection of such relationships, there is a close correspondence between the concept of table and the mathematical concept of relation, from which the relational data model takes its name. 

In mathematical terminology, a tuple is simply a sequence (or list) of values. A relationship between n values is repre-
sented mathematically by an n-tuple of values, i.e., a tuple with n values, which corresponds to a row in a table. In the relational model the term relation is used to refer to a table, while the term tuple is used to refer to a row. Similarly, the term attribute refers to a column of a table. 

We use the term relation instance to refer to a specific instance of a relation, i.e., containing a specific set of rows. The order in which tuples appear in a relation is irrelevant, since a relation is a set of tuples. For each attribute of a relation, there is a set of permitted values, called the domain of that attribute. We require that, for all relations r, the domains of all attributes of r be atomic. A domain is atomic if elements of the domain are considered to be indivisible units. The null value is a special value that signifies that the value is unknown or does not exist.

## Database schema

We must differentiate between the database schema, which is the logical design of the database, and the database instance,
which is a snapshot of the data in the database at a given instant in time. A relation schema consists of a list of attributes and their corresponding domains. A relationship schema corresponds to class and relationship instance to an actual object instance in OOPs design. Often however the same name is used to define both the schema and instance. 

```
department (dept name, building, budget)
```

Not only relational schema exists for nouns but for pure relatons as well.

```
teaches (ID, course id, sec id, semester, year)
```

Sometimes the column can be common in two or more tables and it is a way used to represent relationship between two tables. 

### Keys

Since the relationship is a set of tuples. A tuple is unique. Two tuples are said to be same if both share all the same attributes. 
A superkey is a set of one or more attributes that, taken collectively, allow us to identify uniquely a tuple in the relation.

Formally, let R denote the set of attributes in the schema of relation r . If we say that a subset K of R is a superkey for r , we are restricting consideration to instances of relations r in which no two distinct tuples have the same values on
all attributes in K. That is, if t1 and t2 are in r and `t1 = t2` , then `t1 .K = t2 .K` . Any superset of super key is also superkey.

A superkey with no proper subset as a super key is called candidate key. We shall use the term primary key to denote a candidate key that is chosen by the database designer as the principal means of identifying tuples within a relation. It is customary to list the primary key attributes of a relation schema before the other attributes; for example, the dept name attribute of department is listed first, since it is the primary key. Primary key attributes are also underlined.

A relation, say r1 , may include among its attributes the primary key of another relation, say r2 . This attribute is called a foreign key from r1 , referencing r2 . The relation r1 is also called the referencing relation of the foreign key dependency, and r2 is called the referenced relation of the foreign key. A referential integrity constraint requires that the values appearing in
specified attributes of any tuple in the referencing relation also appear in specified attributes of at least one tuple in the referenced relation.

### Schema diagram

A database schema, along with primary key and foreign key dependencies, can be depicted by schema diagrams. Each relation appears as a box, with the relation name at the top in blue, and the attributes listed inside the box. Primary key attributes are shown underlined. Foreign key dependencies appear as arrows from the foreign key attributes of the referencing relation to the primary key of the referenced relation.

### Relational query language

A query language is a language in which a user requests information from the database. All procedural relational query languages provide a set of operations that can be applied to either a single relation or a pair of relations. These operations have the nice and desired property that their result is always a single relation. Specifically, since the result of a relational query is itself a relation, relational operations can be applied to the results of queries as well as to the given set of relations.

Select opertion is used to get subset of relation again as relation based on some condition. Projection can also be used to get the subset of attributes from relation. The join operation allows the combining of two relations by merging pairs of tuples, one from each relation, into a single tuple.

The Cartesian product operation combines tuples from two relations, but unlike the join operation, its result contains all pairs of tuples from the two relations, regardless of whether their attribute values match.

Because relations are sets, we can perform normal set operations on relations. The union operation performs a set union of two “similarly structured” tables (say a table of all graduate students and a table of all undergraduate students). For example, one can obtain the set of all students in a department. Other set operations, such as intersection and set difference can be performed as well.

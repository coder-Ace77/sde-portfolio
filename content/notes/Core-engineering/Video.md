Hello My self Mohd Adil from June ASDE Gudgaon batch. I graduated in the year 2025 from Indian Institute of Technology Bhilai in Computer Science branch.
I joined the Publicis sapient in June and has been in training since. In the  bootcamp training program which has been running from July 2025, I have learned the following technologies-

1. Front end using react
2. Backend developement using Java and spring boot
3. CI -CD developement using Jenkins
4. Version control system such as git
5. Postgres and MongoDB databases. and many more

To get hands on experience on these technologies I also build a Telecom application mintel which is the full stack application from telecom management application this was deployed on AWS cloud. During this phase we developed the engineering problem solving mindset which also aligns with the Learning mindset of Publicis sapient.

After this our product development phase in Publicis sapient started where I worked on critical issues. First I designed the Architechture of System. The application follows microservice architechture which makes it scalable and highly available. This also enables great performance because entire application is deployed on Kubernetes cluster. In practice we used EKS (Elastic Kubernetes swervice) to deploy the application on cloud.

In the first sprint I worked on the front end of application where my task was to create the component banner which fetches the data from backend.

In the second sprint my story was on backend of designing the order summary backend.

In the third sprint my story was to home page dynamic page. This was again front end story.

In the fourth sprint my story was to do end to end automated integration testing using selenium. I wrote the scripts of flows related to various flows. This is recording of one of flows.

In the fifth sprint I worked on the performance enhancement ofd various end points where I worked on first setting up the jmeter performance server on cloud and then to reduce the response time of services.

In all these sprints this shows that I have worked on various tech stacks and services.

Hello, my name is **Mohd Adil**, and I am currently part of the **ASDE June batch at Publicis Sapient, Gurgaon**. I graduated in **2025 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bhilai**, where I pursued my degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**.

During my academic journey at IIT Bhilai, I built a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals such as data structures, algorithms, operating systems, and databases.

I joined **Publicis Sapient in June 2025**, and since then, I have been part of an intensive **bootcamp training program** that started in July.

Over the course of this training, I learned both **frontend and backend development**. On the frontend side, I leanred **React** which enabled me to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces. On the backend side, I worked with **Java and Spring Boot**, where I got hands-on experience in building RESTful APIs, handling authentication, and ensuring scalability of services.

We also learned about **CI/CD pipelines** using **Jenkins**, which gave me insights into how real-world applications are built, tested, and deployed continuously. Alongside this, I worked with **version control systems like Git**, which is critical for collaboration in teams. In terms of databases, I gained experience in both **relational databases such as PostgreSQL** and **NoSQL databases such as MongoDB**.

To gain the hands on experience on the learned tech stack I also worked on a full stack application Mintel which is a telecom service management application. Building this application helped me gain practical knowledge of modern software applications.

After this I worked on Product development phase and worked on various crucial areas of application. I first designed the system architechture of applciation. It follows the micro service architecture which makes application highly available and scalable. To deploy this application on the cloud, we used **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**, which provided orchestration for containers and improved overall system performance and resilience. This exposure to microservices and Kubernetes gave me a deeper understanding of building modern, cloud-native applications.

During the first srpint I worked on the frontend by creating a **banner component** that fetched and displayed data from the backend. This taught me how to integrate frontend with APIs effectively.

In the seond sprint I shifted to work on the backend logic of order summary page which appears once user has successfully completed the payment.

In **Sprint 3**, I worked again on the frontend, building a **dynamic homepage** that adjusted based on user data and backend responses.

In **Sprint 4**, my focus was on **automation testing**. I wrote **end-to-end integration tests using Selenium** to validate user journeys across the application.

In **Sprint 5**, I concentrated on **performance improvements**. I set up a **JMeter performance server on the cloud** to test our APIs under load. I also analyzed the bottlenecks in response times and worked on optimizing backend endpoints to improve performance.

Through these experiences, I got exposure to **every layer of the technology stack**—from frontend to backend, from testing to performance, and from deployment to cloud infrastructure. What I particularly enjoyed about this journey was that I was not restricted to one area. I got opportunities to explore **frontend, backend, databases, DevOps, automation, and performance engineering**.

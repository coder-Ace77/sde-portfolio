Hello everyone, welcome to the final demo of 2025 june ASDE gurgaon batch. 

In this demo we will begin with our ps jouney, followed by problem statment and then demo of our product, afterwards we will go through the application architecture and Non functional requeirements. We will end the presentation with the question and answer session.

Our PS Journey is divided into 4 stages. Before joining the organisation we went through a 6 week Pre joining Training Program where we learned about basics of Java , Data Structures and algorithms and Basics of front end.

After joining the organisation we went through PS start where we learned about the company's culture.

The philosophy of **Learn by Doing, Learn by Sharing, and Learn by Observation** truly guided our journey in the 5-week learning phase. Here we learned about Core java, Spring boot ,Test driven developement and Html, front end development using React. We also learned about the devops tools such as jenkins, docker, Kubernetes and had introduction to cloud like AWS. 

This was followed by a 7 week product development phase where we developed the application. We followed the TTD approach throughout. In the sprint 0 we set up the application and then major features were developed in first 4 weeks. Finally in the last two sprints we focused on stabilizing the application and fixing bugs.

To streamline the process we focussed on development using agile manner where we conducted scrum ceremonies such as spring planning and spring retrospective. We also used jira as project management tool. 

Now, I would invite Arnav to present the problem statement.

Adil: "Hey guys! How have you been? How did you all spend the last month.
I spent most of my time chilling at home, surfing through the web.

Sonam: "Hi everyone! Oh nothing much, it was just the usual stuff- the same monotonous routine. What about u guys??"

Arnav: "Hi guys ! I had a blast last month. I went on a trip to Prague and just returned the day before.I bought a nintendo switch that is not available in India. But my suitcase… oof, it gave me such a hard time. I ought to buy a new one, but all the good ones like Chatelet are so expensive.

Adil: "Oh nice Arnav, happy to hear u had a great time, But uk what, even I got my hands on something really nice! So I bought this amazing new Rolex watch and that too for just 82 grand. U remember Arnav the moonphase rolex that we were admiring right? That one."

Sonam: "Oh did you? Actually mine was not that bad as well. I even got something that can surprise you all. I got the brand new Oppo F19 Pro Plus from an exclusive sale at a whopping 30% discount. Isn’t that amazing?"

Arnav: “What?? I am so jealous right now. Adil..How did you get your hands on the Rolex for just 82K rupees and Sonam, tell me more,  30% discount for a brand new phone sounds unreal.

Sonam: "Ah actually Arnav you missed quite a lot. I found a new website Intersellar which had a Birthday sale going on and there were not just one but many sales on that website. Oh god how happy I feel to even talk about it. I bought so many things, from clothing, home decor to what not and all for a great discount thanks to all the sales that were there."

Adil:”What a coincidence Sonam, I bought the rolex on that same website. Oh Arnav U have actually missed a lot. 

Arnav: Aww man. And I missed all these sales? That is so unfortunate. Wish I could go back in time and seize the discounts.

Adil: "But there is good news. Those sales although expired are still very much there for you."

Arnav :”What do u mean? I thought the sales had expired. Am I some VIP? Why would they extend the sale duration just for me and provide the items for the discounted prices? I think u guys are just making fun of me.”

sonam:”Arnav its not like that. Infact I saw a suitcase sale amongst the sales that were there which you would definitely want to rewind to.  
  
Arnav :Rewind to? Am I missing something here.

Adil: So Arnav  we are talking about intersellar right? That website provides a unique feature TIME REWIND using which we can access past sales that expired within the last 10 days. Open the site right now and we will help you buy the suitcase.

Adil: I believe the rolex was on "Navratri" sale.
Arnav: Thanks Adil!

Learn by doing --- We **learned by doing** as we actively coded and developed projects using **Core Java, Spring Boot, Test-Driven Development, and front-end technologies like HTML and React**. This hands-on approach allowed us to internalize concepts and overcome real-world challenges.

Learn by sharing --- Through **learn by sharing**, we engaged in collaborative sessions and peer discussions, exchanging insights and best practices which enriched our understanding and fostered a supportive learning environment.  through KTs 

Learn by observation --- Finally, we **learned by observation** by closely examining workflows and processes involving DevOps tools like **Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes**, and got introduced to cloud technologies such as **AWS**. Observing these systems in action helped us grasp their practical applications and integration in modern software development.

To go deep into Minikube, you need to understand it not just as a tool, but as a **virtualized infrastructure-as-code** manager. Minikube doesn't "run" Kubernetes directly on your OS (unless you use the `none` driver). Instead, it creates a sandbox using a **Driver**.

| **Driver**           | **How it works**                                                                                            | **Best For...**                                        |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Docker** (Default) | Runs Minikube inside a Docker container.                                                                    | Fast startup, low overhead.                            |
| **KVM2 / QEMU**      | Uses Linux Kernel Virtual Machine for full virtualization.(Need to install underlying virtualization tools) | Isolation and simulating "real" hardware nodes.        |
| **VirtualBox**       | Standard VM approach.                                                                                       | Cross-platform consistency.                            |
| **None**             | Runs K8s components directly on your host Linux.                                                            | High performance, but messes with your host's network. |
When you run `minikube start`, it downloads a specialized ISO (minikube.iso) containing a stripped-down Linux, a container runtime (Docker/Containerd), and the Kubernetes binaries (`kubelet`, `kubeadm`).

With the minikube cli api we have to privide it one command and then set of options. Note that we can get info about base commands using `minikube --help` and to get info about options use 
`minikube top-commnad --help`
#### start

```bash
minikube start
```

start is the basic command used to set up the kubectl environment. In start we can also select the-

- driver
- memory -  totol memory of cluster
- cpu - total cpus 
- kubernetes version - to run specific version
- total nodes etc

For all the commands available use `minikube start --help`. There are about 100 options available.

```bash
minikube start --driver=docker --memory=2gb --cpus=12 --nodes=2
```

#### stop,pause and delete

With stop its graceful shutdown. All your deployments, pods, and configurations are **saved to the virtual disk**. The RAM and CPU being hogged by the cluster are returned to your host machine. Your data is safe. When you run `minikube start` again later, the cluster resumes exactly where you left off.

```bash
minikube stop
minikube stop --schedule=10m # Schedule the stop after some time
```


```bash
minikube pause
```

Delete on the other hand wipes the VM/container and deletes all associated local files. Everything (Pods, Services, Namespaces) is gone forever.

| **Command**       | **Action**              | **Data Kept?** | **Resources Freed?** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| `minikube start`  | Boot up the K8s cluster | Yes (Resumes)  | No (Consumes)        |
| `minikube stop`   | Hibernates the cluster  | **Yes**        | **Yes**              |
| `minikube pause`  | Freezes processes       | Yes            | Partial (RAM stays)  |
| `minikube delete` | Destroys the cluster    | **No**         | Yes                  |
To get the status of cluster

```bash
minikube status
```

minikube also provides a good web based dashboard. 

```bash
minikube dashboard
```

It enables the dashboard add-on and opens your default browser to the local URL.

```bash
minikube service webapp --url
```

When you run a web app in Minikube, it’s tucked away inside the cluster's internal network. Your computer's browser can't see it by default.
- **What it does:** It creates a tunnel (or provides a URL) to bridge your local machine to a service running inside the cluster.
- **Useful Flag:** `minikube service <name> --url` just gives you the address without opening the browser.

```bash
minikube ip
```

Minikube runs in a VM or a container, which means it has its own internal IP address separate from `localhost` (127.0.0.1).
- **What it does:** Returns the IP address of the Minikube node.
- **Why use it:** If you are using `NodePort` to expose your apps, you’ll need this IP to access them (e.g., `http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>`).

minikube has certain extra fatures which can accessed and enabled by 

```bash
minikube addons list
minikube addons enable <name>
```

Sometimes, things go wrong at the system level. If your pods won't start and the logs aren't helping, you might need to go "inside" the machine. 

```bash
minikube ssh
```

ssh opens a terminal session directly inside the Minikube node (the VM or container).

Finally minikube also provides the logs of clusters internal components. 

```bash
minikube logs
minikube logs -f
```

Finally we can add or remove nodes by using `minikube node`

```bash
minikube node --help
Operations on nodes

Available Commands:
  add           Adds a node to the given cluster.
  delete        Deletes a node from a cluster.
  list          List nodes.
  start         Starts a node.
  stop          Stops a node in a cluster.
```

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS.
EKS simplifies running Kubernetes clusters on AWS without needing to manage the Kubernetes control plane yourself. AWS handles the Kubernetes master nodes, control plane, and etcd database, ensuring high availability and scalability, so you can focus on deploying and managing your applications.

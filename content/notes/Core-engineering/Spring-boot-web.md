### Controllers:

In Spring’s approach to building RESTful web services, HTTP requests are handled by a controller. These components are identified by the `@RestController`.

Note that we only write the Annotation and then the class rest is handled by the spring.

The `@GetMapping` annotation ensures that HTTP GET requests to `/greeting` are mapped to the `greeting()` method.

|There are companion annotations for other HTTP verbs (e.g. `@PostMapping` for POST). There is also a `@RequestMapping` annotation that they all derive from, and can serve as a synonym (e.g. `@RequestMapping(method=GET)`).|

```java
package com.example.restservice;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicLong; 
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping; 
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam; 
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController; 

@RestController
public class GreetingController {
	private static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
	private final AtomicLong counter = new AtomicLong();
	
	@GetMapping("/greeting")
	public Greeting greeting(@RequestParam(defaultValue = "World") String name) { 
		return new Greeting(counter.incrementAndGet(), String.format(template, name)); 
		
	} 
}
```

`@RequestParam` binds the value of the query string parameter `name` into the `name` parameter of the `greeting()` method. If the `name` parameter is absent in the request, the `defaultValue` of `World` is used.

A key difference between a traditional MVC controller and the RESTful web service controller shown earlier is the way that the HTTP response body is created. Rather than relying on a view technology to perform server-side rendering of the greeting data to HTML, this RESTful web service controller populates and returns a `Greeting` object. The object data will be written directly to the HTTP response as JSON.

This code uses Spring [`@RestController`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RestController.html) annotation, which marks the class as a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view. It is shorthand for including both `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

The `Greeting` object must be converted to JSON. Thanks to Spring’s HTTP message converter support, you need not do this conversion manually. Because [Jackson 2](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is on the classpath, Spring’s [`MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter`](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/converter/json/MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter.html) is automatically chosen to convert the `Greeting` instance to JSON.

#### Internals:

When you annotate a class with `@Controller` (or `@RestController` for REST APIs), it is marked as a Spring-managed bean, and the Spring container will automatically register it as a component during the **component scanning** process.

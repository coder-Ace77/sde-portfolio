# 7. Two Pointer

---

Two pointer paradigm is usually about monotonicity argument for example somewhere where we can have a monotonic conditions. The most basic questions of there are

### 2 sum

The idea is to find in a sorted array if sum of two numbers is equal to `target`. Now we have two pointers left starting from 0 and right starting from `n-1`.  If sum of `arr[left]+arr[right]>target` then we need to reduce the sum so we can move right back. However if sum if is lesser we can move left forward. This enables us to solve the problem pretty easily.

```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int i=0,j=nums.size()-1;
        while(i<j){
            if(nums[i]+nums[j]>target){
                j--;
            }else if(nums[i]+nums[j]<target){
            i++;
        }else{
        return vector<int>{i+1,j+1};
    }
}
return vector<int>{-1,-1};
}
};

```

### Is subsequence

In this question given two arrays we need to find if array `a` is the subsequence of array `b`. The idea is to solve on the the two pointers `i` , `j`

`i` = current index of array `a`
`j` = the index uptill we have a match

Now we can see if `a[i]==b[j]` then `i` and `j` both will move forward otherwise only i will move forward and j will remain same.

```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int i=0,j=0;
        while(i<t.size() && j<s.size()){
            if(t[i]==s[j]){
                i++;
                j++;
            }else{
            i++;
        }
    }
    return (j==s.size());
}
};

```

### Container with most water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Solution

Again two pointer we will move the pointer of smaller height becasue as the length will be reduced but since the hieght is supposed to increased we may get better answer.

```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxArea = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            maxArea = max(maxArea, (right - left) * min(height[left], height[right]));

            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
            right--;
        }
    }

    return maxArea;
}
};

```

String is a sequence of one or more characters enclosedin single or double quotes.

```javascript
let x = "Hello";
console.log(x[0]);
console.log(x.charAt(0));
```

[ ] returns undefined if index is out of range.
charAt() retruns empty string

String values are immutable once created. So any operation that seems to modify the string value actually creates new string. Original string remains unchanged in memory.

In practice, this means that operations like concatenation, trimming, or replacing characters in a string result in the creation of new strings. For example, when handling user inputs or dynamically generating text in web applications, developers must be aware that manipulating strings results in new string instances, which can impact performance and memory usage in large-scale applications.

### Strict mode

Strict mode changes previously accepted bad syntax into real errors. For example with strict mode we can't use undeclared variables.

```javascript

// no strict mode - string does not changes but no error is given
let str = "Adil";
str[0]="B";

// strict mode - gives type error -> 
let str = "Adil";
str[0]="B";

```

### Template strings:

1. Allows multiline string formatting.
2. enclosed in back ticks.

```javascript
let x = 10;
let str = `${x} is the value 
			of x`;
```

### Some string methods:

1. indexOf() : searches string start index of string.
2. substring(startPos,endPos) - extracts a part of a string and returns it in a new string.Starting position is from startPos (inclusive) ending is not inclusive.
3. str1.concat(str2) or use + operator to concat strings.

```javascript

let str = "Hello";
str=str.concat(" ","World"," ","!");
let x="Hello, ".concat("world!")
```

Observe that string methods are available to string literals as well.

```javascript

// conversions

let str = "Hello";
str = str.toUpperCase();
str = "WORLD".toLowerCase();

// extracts a substring
"Mohd Adil".slice(0,4); // returns Mohd

// split returns the array of strings splitted by delimiter
"apple, banana, cherry".split(", ") //results in **["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

// replace returns the new string after replacing specified substring with new one 
"I like coffee".replace("coffee", "tea") // "I like tea"

// trim removes white spaces from both end of string.
" Hello World ".trim()  //results in **"Hello World"

```

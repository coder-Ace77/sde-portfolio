ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features and improvements to the JavaScript language. Here is a concise and structured overview of some of the key features introduced in ES6:  

- let and const: ES6 introduced block-scoped variables using the let and const keywords. let allows declaring variables that are limited to the block scope, while const is used for declaring constants that cannot be reassigned.
- Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a shorter syntax, lexical this binding, and implicit return for one-liner functions.
- Template Literals: Template literals allow embedding expressions inside string literals using backticks (`). This feature provides an easier way to concatenate strings and variables, making the code more readable.
- Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring assignment allows extracting values from arrays or objects into individual variables. It provides a concise way to assign values and access nested properties.
- Spread Operator: The spread operator (...) allows expanding elements of an iterable (like an array or string) into individual elements. It can be used for array concatenation, function arguments, and object cloning.
- Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax for creating objects with a constructor and methods. It provides a more familiar syntax for defining classes and inheritance in JavaScript.
- Modules: ES6 introduced a standardized module system using the import and export keywords. Modules allow organizing code into separate files and provide better encapsulation and reusability.
- Promises: Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. They represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allow chaining multiple asynchronous operations together.
- Default Parameters: ES6 allows defining default values for function parameters. If a parameter is not provided, the default value will be used instead.
- Enhanced Object Literals: ES6 introduced enhancements to object literals, including shorthand property and method definitions, computed property names, and the ability to define setters and getters.

These are just a few of the many features introduced in ES6. These additions have significantly improved the JavaScript language, making it more powerful, expressive, and easier to work with.

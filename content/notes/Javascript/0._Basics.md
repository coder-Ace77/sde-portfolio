Javascript can added to a webiste by two ways - 

1. using inline script tags - 

```html
<script>
	alert("Hello")
</script>
```

we can also import javascript using script import

```html
<script src="script.js" type="module" defer></script>
```

This can be added in any part of html document for example head body etc. Browsers read html files sequencially meaning as soon as it encounters any script tag it will stop html parse and will strart execution of js code.
So if one imports js in head we can use defer to start execution untill entire html page is read. 

type module means it is javascript module not a regular js script. Inside a module file we can use regular import and export. Secondly modules are leaded defered by default. Finally module code is in scrict mode by default. Module variables are scoped not global. 

**Strict mode** is a special mode in JavaScript that makes the language **more secure, predictable, and less error-prone**.
We can turn on it by writing - 

```js
'use strict';
```

# 4.Objects

Made up of key value pairs

- Objects are made up of key-value pairs know as properties.
- All object keys are automatically converted to strings (unless using `Symbol`). So key 123 is internally converted to "123". With [] notation it accepts expressions which are evaulated and converted to string.
- So accessing obj[123] converts to obj["123"].

```javascript
let obj = {};
obj[123] = "number";
console.log(obj["123"]); // "number"

```

3 ways to create:

1. Using object literal
2. Empty object and then adding properties
3. using new keyword

```javascript
const Person = {
    name:"Dr Jack",
    age:19
}

let obj = new Object();
obj.name = "Adil";
obj.age = 23;

```

### Way of accessing [] vs .

[] and . both provide a way to access value using keys. [] can be used to access the dynamic keys.
. operator only works if key has no space.

```javascript
let key = "full name";
console.log(obj[key]); // "Adil"

// adding property
obj[key] = val;
// delete a property
delete obj[key];
// check if property exist or not
key in obj

```

When using dot notation(.) to access values in objects, it requires a valid property name after the dot. While using the bracket notation([ ]), we can pass expressions between the brackets which are evaluated to get the property name.

```javascript
// valid
obj.name
// invalid
obj.1
//valid
obj[1]

```

#### Object destructuring

Object destructuring assigns the properties of an object to variables with the same names by default.

```javascript
let {firstName , lastName , position, email} = obj;
const [a1,a2,a3] = arr; // destructing the array

```

typeof in JavaScript is an operator used for type checking and returns a string indicating the data type of the expression written in front of it.

```javascript
console.log(typeof x);
// gives type of object

```

Objects can also have functions inside However they are not defined as key value pair.

```js
const user = {
    name:'Max',
    age: 34,
    greet(){
        // access to the all the fields of user
        console.log("Hello"+this.name)
    }
}

user.greet();

```

The destructuring syntax explained in the previous lecture can also be used in **function parameter lists**.

```js
function storeOrder({id, currency}) { // destructuring
localStorage.setItem('id', id);
localStorage.setItem('currency', currency);
}

```

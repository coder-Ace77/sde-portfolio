Recap of multiprogamming model here we keep multiple process in memory at a time. When one process waits for i/o to be completed the OS takes away the cpu from that process and allocates it to some other process. 
A process always alternates between two states I/O burst and CPU burst. A process always begins with CPu burst. 

An I/O boud process has many short cpu burst while a cpu bound process has few long bursts.

## CPU scheduler

Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the operating system must select one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed. The selection process is carried out by the short-term scheduler, or CPU scheduler.

Under nonpreemptive scheduling, once the CPU has been allocated to a process, the process keeps the CPU until it releases the CPU either by terminating or by switching to the waiting state. In preemptive a process running can be prempt out by another process. Unfortunately, preemptive scheduling can result in race conditions when data are shared among several processes.

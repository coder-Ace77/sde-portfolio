Hard disks are the most common on-line storage medium.The operating system abstracts from the physical properties of its storage devices to define a logical storage, the file. A file is a named collection of related information that is recorded on secondary storage. A file is the smallest allotment of logical secondary storage. Data cannot be written to secondary storage unless they are within a file.  Files store both code and data. File formats – magic number.

To provide efficient and convenient access to the disk, the operating system imposes a file system to allow data to be stored, located and retrieved easily.

The file system is typically implemented as a multi-leveled system.
A directory is a logical construct representing a set of files and subdirectories.

Implementing a file system –
- boot control block (volume) - information needed to boot an operating system from that
volume, if there is one
- volume control block (volume) - information about the volume
- master file table (volume) – information about the directory structure
- file control block (file) - information about the file


Transfer rate: rate at which data is transferred between the bus and the disk.
Seek time: time taken to move the arm to the cylinder.
Rotational latency: time taken to rotate the disk so that the head comes over the sector.
Positioning time (random access time) = seek time + rotational latency.
Performance of a disk depends on transfer rate and positioning time.

A traditional disk (HDD) consists of:
- **Platters**: Circular disks coated with magnetic material
- **Spindle**: Rotates all platters at constant speed (e.g., 5400 / 7200 RPM)
- **Read/Write Head**: One per surface, mounted on an arm
- **Arm Assembly**: Moves heads across platters

Each platter surface is divided into:
- **Tracks**: Concentric circles
- **Sectors**: Smallest unit of storage (usually 512 bytes or 4 KB)
- **Cylinder**: Set of tracks at the same radius across all platters

From the OS point of view:
- Disk is seen as a **linear array of logical blocks**
- Each block has a **logical block address (LBA)**
- OS does not worry about tracks/sectors directly (modern disks abstract this)

When the OS requests data from disk, total access time =
1. **Seek Time**  
    Time taken for the disk arm to move the head to the correct track  
    (Largest contributor)
2. **Rotational Latency**  
    Time for the desired sector to rotate under the head  
    Average ≈ half rotation
3. **Transfer Time**  
    Time to actually read/write data

$$
\text{Disk Access Time} = \text{Seek Time} + \text{Rotational Latency} + \text{Transfer Time}
$$

Disk scheduling is needed reason being its not random access like memory. Different places access need different time. The transfer time of a contnous block is fast but there is a seek which is usually slow.

Different scheduling schemes are first come first serve(FCFS),shortest seek time first(SSTF) where we choose the block which can be accesed first,SCAN here head moves in one direction only and taking out blocks needed. 

Disks also need formatting which means filling the disk with certain data structure for each sector this data structure has header, data area and trailer. This is called physical formatting there is another logcial formatting as well which creates file system.
